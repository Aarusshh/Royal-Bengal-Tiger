It can be even seen on Bangladeshi money. Bengal tigers in India are mainly found in subtropical and temperate upland forests. 
        They are powerful hunters and most active at dusk and dawn, when they use tall grass and tress to stalk prey and silently attack. They are famous for their rival-attacking activities.</font></p>

<br><font size="5"><font color="darkgreen"> Why are Bengal Tigers endagered? </font> 
        
<font size="5"><p style="color:black">Bengal tigers are under constant threat of poaching. They are hunted illegally because their skin and some body parts considered useful for 
traditional Asian medicine. Their bones are used for treating malaria, typhoid and other ailments. They also face popullation fragmentation, habitat loss, and reduction of their usual prey.
High population growth in India has reduced the range the Bengal tiger critically needs for its survival. Construction of roadways and crop cultivation has not only fragmented the Bengal tiger's territory, it has also reduced the availability of prey.</p>

<p style="color: black">The tigers' habitat range is 20 times smaller than what it was at the start of the 20th century. Between the 1940s and the 1980s, 3 of the 8 tiger subspecies had already disappeared â€“ the Caspian, Bali and Java tiger did not survive hunting, poaching, and deforestation.
Bengal tigers are perceived to be among the most dangerous animals in India, and they have therefore been hunted as a trophy for big game hunters.</p>
